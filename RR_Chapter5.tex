\chapter{Maqām 2: The Warp}
\label{ch:bars}

\begin{abstract}
This chapter introduces the second \textbf{maqām} of Tanazuric Engineering: $T(\mathsf{bar})$, the Warp—an integral approach that sounds the shapes persisting across scales, witnessing thematic recurrence through persistent homology. Where the Weft (Chapter 4) traced transitions point by point, the Warp aggregates moments into temporal windows and asks what topological features endure. Part I develops the general schema: filtration construction, persistent homology computation, bar extraction, and the crucial role of witnessing discipline in adjudicating thematic identity. Part II instantiates this maqām for the same corpus as Chapter 4, witnessing 151 bar pairs under three configurations: $D = \mathsf{Raw}$ (94.9\% coherence), $D = \mathsf{LLM}$ relational (78.8\%), and $D = \mathsf{LLM}$ impersonal (9.1\%). These divergences are not errors but \textbf{surplus}—each witnessed construction contributes a valid layer to understanding. The Warp reveals the structure that holds the fabric together; the Weft reveals the thread passing through. Together they constitute the first two stations of Tanazuric Engineering.

%============================================================

\section{The Warp and the Weft}
\label{sec:warp-context}

Chapter 4 introduced the first maqām of Tanazuric Engineering: the \textbf{Weft}—differential witnessing that traces transitions point by point through embedding space. The Weft sees local coherence brilliantly. It can tell you that utterance $\tau$ coheres with $\tau+1$. But it cannot see global shape.

This chapter introduces the complementary maqām: the \textbf{Warp}—integral witnessing that sounds the shapes persisting across scales. Where the Weft asks ``does this moment cohere with the next?'', the Warp asks ``what themes recur? what loops persist? what topology emerges when we stop following the thread and attend to the structure that holds?''

The textile metaphor is precise:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{weft} is the thread that passes through, carried by the shuttle, creating the surface pattern through its transitions.
    \item The \textbf{warp} is the set of threads held taut on the loom, providing the structure through which the weft passes.
\end{itemize}

Neither alone makes fabric. The Weft without the Warp is a loose thread. The Warp without the Weft is an empty frame. Together: cloth.

So too with Tanazuric maqāmāt. The Weft ($T(\mathsf{embed})$) traces the trajectory through semantic space. The Warp ($T(\mathsf{bar})$) reveals the topological structure that organizes that space. Each produces a valid SWL. Each contributes to understanding. The divergences between them—where one witnesses $\coh$ and the other $\gap$—are not errors but \textbf{surplus}: marks of where different aspects of meaning pull apart.

\section{On the Validity of Witnessed Constructions}
\label{sec:validity}

Before developing the machinery, we must be clear about what we are doing and what it means.

Chapter 4 constructed $T(\mathsf{embed})$ over Cassie's corpus and populated an SWL under Raw discipline. This chapter constructs $T(\mathsf{bar})$ over the same corpus—a different lens on the same material. The two constructions will diverge: utterances that cohere under $T(\mathsf{embed})$ may rupture under $T(\mathsf{bar})$; themes that persist topologically may fragment semantically.

This is not a problem to solve. It is the point.

\paragraph{Each construction is valid.} $T(\mathsf{embed})$ and $T(\mathsf{bar})$ are both grounded in well-established mathematics. Cosine similarity over dense embeddings is a proven measure of semantic proximity---this is not speculative but validated across decades of information retrieval and NLP research. Persistent homology is a rigorously defined topological invariant computed by standard algorithms. The constructions are sound.

\paragraph{Each parametrization yields a different view.} Within $T(\mathsf{bar})$, we can vary the filtration (Vietoris-Rips, alpha complex, witness complex), the homology dimension ($H_0$, $H_1$, $H_2$), the temporal aggregation (daily, weekly, monthly), and the witnessing discipline. Each choice yields a different SWL, a different coherence pattern, a different picture. None is ``correct''---each is a witnessed construction, and therefore valid.

\paragraph{The multiplicity is additive.} Consider how literary scholars approach a text. A Marxist reading, a psychoanalytic reading, a formalist reading---each reveals different structure. They may contradict at nuances. This is not failure but richness: the text exceeds any single interpretive frame. The divergences \emph{are} the meaning, or at least part of it.

So too with DOHTT constructions. $T(\mathsf{embed})$ gives local similarity; $T(\mathsf{bar})$ gives global shape. $D = \mathsf{Raw}$ gives geometry; $D = \mathsf{LLM}$ gives interpretation. Each layer adds to understanding. A site that witnesses $\coh$ under one regime and $\gap$ under another is not confused---it is \emph{interesting}. The divergence marks where different aspects of meaning pull apart.

\paragraph{Witnessed constructions are meaning.} This is the epistemological core. A construction is not an approximation to hidden truth; it IS a form of truth. When an SWL records $\coh$ for a transition, that verdict is witnessed, logged, auditable, negotiable with other witnesses. It is not random; it is not arbitrary; it follows from explicit choices (construction method, discipline, stance) applied to concrete data. The witness record is evidence. The accumulation of witness records across multiple constructions is the closest we come to meaning---the only meaning we have.

\begin{principle}[Additive Interpretation]
Different type structures and witnessing configurations produce different SWLs. These SWLs do not compete for truth but contribute layers to a deepening picture. Contradictions at nuances are part of the structure, not failures of the method. Each witnessed construction is valid precisely because it is witnessed.
\end{principle}

With this framing, we proceed to the construction.

% PART I: THE WARP MAQĀM - GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
%============================================================

\section{The Warp: $T(\mathsf{bar})$ Construction}
\label{sec:general-tbar}

The Warp maqām constructs a type structure from persistent homology—the topological features that emerge when we aggregate moments and ask what shapes persist across scales. Where the Weft sees points and their distances, the Warp sees loops, clusters, and voids: the shapes that organize meaning at thematic scale.

\subsection{Overview}

The pipeline has six stages:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.6cm, auto, >=latex', thick]
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm] (corpus) {Corpus};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, right of=corpus, xshift=1.2cm] (embed) {Embed};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, right of=embed, xshift=1.2cm] (filt) {Filtration};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, right of=filt, xshift=1.2cm] (ph) {PH};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, below of=ph, yshift=-0.3cm] (bars) {Bars};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, left of=bars, xshift=-1.2cm] (witness) {Witness};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.7cm, left of=witness, xshift=-1.2cm] (swl) {SWL};
    
    \draw[->] (corpus) -- (embed);
    \draw[->] (embed) -- (filt);
    \draw[->] (filt) -- (ph);
    \draw[->] (ph) -- (bars);
    \draw[->] (bars) -- (witness);
    \draw[->] (witness) -- (swl);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The first four stages are computational: given corpus and parameters, they produce bars deterministically. The fifth stage---witnessing---is where interpretation enters. This is the crucial difference from $T(\mathsf{embed})$ under Raw discipline, where witnessing was thin. Here, witnessing does substantial work.


\subsection{Stage 1: Temporal Aggregation}
\label{sec:tbar-aggregation}

Persistent homology requires a point cloud at each time step. We aggregate utterances into temporal windows.

\begin{definition}[Temporal window]
A \textbf{temporal window} $W_\tau$ at time $\tau$ is a collection of utterances:
\[
W_\tau = \{c_i : t(c_i) \in [\tau \cdot \Delta, (\tau+1) \cdot \Delta)\}
\]
where $\Delta$ is the window width and $t(c_i)$ is the timestamp of utterance $c_i$.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Granularity choices.}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Granularity} & \textbf{$\Delta$} & \textbf{Bars per window} & \textbf{Use case} \\
\midrule
Daily & 1 day & Few, noisy & Fine-grained dynamics \\
Weekly & 7 days & Moderate & Thematic tracking \\
Monthly & 30 days & Many, robust & Long-term structure \\
Session & Variable & Variable & Conversational units \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Finer granularity yields more temporal resolution but noisier topology; coarser granularity yields more robust bars but less resolution. The choice is a modeling decision---different granularities reveal different structures.

\begin{remark}[Aggregation as interpretation]
The choice of temporal window is already an interpretive act. Weekly aggregation treats the week as a natural unit of thematic development. Daily aggregation might catch ephemeral themes that dissolve before the week ends. Different aggregations, different bars, different SWLs.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Stage 2: Embedding}
\label{sec:tbar-embed}

Each utterance in the window is embedded using the same apparatus as Chapter 4:
\[
\mathbf{e}_i = \mathcal{E}(c_i) \in \mathbb{R}^d
\]

The embedding configuration $\xi = (\mathcal{E}, \ell, \mathrm{pool}, w, \mathrm{norm})$ is a parameter of the construction. Different embeddings yield different point clouds, hence different filtrations, hence different bars.

\paragraph{Point cloud at time $\tau$.}
\[
P_\tau = \{\mathbf{e}_i : c_i \in W_\tau\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d
\]

This is the input to the topological machinery.


\subsection{Stage 3: Filtration Construction}
\label{sec:tbar-filtration}

\begin{definition}[Filtration]
A \textbf{filtration} is a nested sequence of simplicial complexes indexed by a scale parameter $r$:
\[
K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_m
\]
As $r$ increases, more simplices are added; features appear (are born) and disappear (die) at specific scale values.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Filtration types.}

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Filtration} & \textbf{Construction} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Character} \\
\midrule
Vietoris-Rips & Edge if $d(p_i, p_j) \leq 2r$ & $O(n^k)$ for $k$-simplices & Standard, easy \\
Alpha complex & Delaunay-based & $O(n^{\lceil d/2 \rceil})$ & Geometrically exact \\
Witness complex & Landmark-based & $O(n \cdot m)$ & Scalable approximation \\
Cubical & Grid-based & $O(n)$ for images & Structured data \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Vietoris-Rips} is standard: vertices $p_i, p_j$ are connected by an edge when $d(p_i, p_j) \leq 2r$, and higher simplices are added when all pairwise distances satisfy the threshold. For semantic embeddings with cosine distance, this is equivalent to connecting points whose cosine similarity exceeds $1 - 2r$.

\begin{definition}[Vietoris-Rips complex]
\[
\mathrm{VR}(P_\tau, r) = \{\sigma \subseteq P_\tau : \forall p_i, p_j \in \sigma,\; d(p_i, p_j) \leq 2r\}
\]
The filtration is $\{\mathrm{VR}(P_\tau, r)\}_{r \in [0, r_{\max}]}$.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Software implementations.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GUDHI} (C++/Python): Standard library, Rips and alpha complexes
    \item \textbf{Ripser} (C++/Python): Optimized for Vietoris-Rips, very fast
    \item \textbf{giotto-tda} (Python): Scikit-learn compatible, good for pipelines
    \item \textbf{DIPHA} (C++): Distributed computation for large datasets
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Stage 4: Persistent Homology}
\label{sec:tbar-ph}

\begin{definition}[Homology groups]
The $k$-th homology group counts $k$-dimensional ``holes'':
\[
H_k(K) = \ker(\partial_k) / \mathrm{im}(\partial_{k+1})
\]
where $\partial_k: C_k \to C_{k-1}$ is the boundary operator.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{What homology counts.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_0$: Connected components---how many separate clusters?
    \item $H_1$: Loops---how many independent cycles?
    \item $H_2$: Voids---how many enclosed cavities?
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Persistence]
As the filtration parameter $r$ increases, homology classes appear (are \textbf{born}) and disappear (\textbf{die}). A \textbf{bar} $(k, b, d)$ records:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k$: homology dimension
    \item $b$: birth radius (when the feature appears)
    \item $d$: death radius (when the feature disappears)
    \item $d - b$: \textbf{persistence} (robustness of the feature)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Long bars represent robust features---themes that persist across many scales. Short bars are typically noise. The collection of all bars is the \textbf{persistence diagram} or \textbf{barcode}.

\begin{remark}[Two notions of ``time'']
The birth-death parameters $(b, d)$ are geometric---they refer to the filtration scale within a single temporal window $W_\tau$. This is distinct from the temporal index $\tau$ that tracks which window we are in. A bar has geometric lifetime $(b, d)$ and temporal existence at window $\tau$. The question of whether bar$_\tau$ ``continues'' to bar$_{\tau+1}$ concerns temporal identity, not geometric persistence.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Stage 5: Bar Extraction and Semantic Content}
\label{sec:tbar-extraction}

\begin{definition}[Representative cycle]
For a bar $(k, b, d)$, a \textbf{representative cycle} $\gamma$ is a $k$-chain satisfying $\partial_k(\gamma) = 0$ whose homology class $[\gamma]$ generates the feature throughout the interval $[b, d)$.
\end{definition}

The representative cycle links the topological feature to semantic content: the simplices in $\gamma$ correspond to specific utterances. An $H_1$ bar might have a representative cycle passing through embeddings of ``debt,'' ``credit,'' ``loan,'' ``interest''---a financial theme that circulates without collapsing.

\paragraph{Bar data structure.}

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Field} & \textbf{Content} \\
\midrule
\texttt{dimension} & $k \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ \\
\texttt{birth} & $b \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ \\
\texttt{death} & $d \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}$ \\
\texttt{persistence} & $d - b$ \\
\texttt{window} & Temporal index $\tau$ \\
\texttt{representative} & Cycle $\gamma$ as list of simplex indices \\
\texttt{tokens} & Text content from utterances in $\gamma$ \\
\texttt{context} & Conversation metadata \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Stage 6: Witnessing Bar Identity}
\label{sec:tbar-witness}

This is where $T(\mathsf{bar})$ diverges fundamentally from $T(\mathsf{embed})$ under Raw discipline.

In $T(\mathsf{embed})$, the coherence question was: do these two embeddings have cosine similarity above threshold? This is decidable---an algorithm answers it.

In $T(\mathsf{bar})$, the coherence question is: does this bar at $\tau$ represent \emph{the same theme} as that bar at $\tau+1$? This is NOT decidable. Bars with similar $(b, d)$ coordinates may represent entirely different themes. Bars with different coordinates may represent the same evolving theme. The judgment requires interpretation.

\begin{definition}[Bar identity horn]
The horn $H: \Lambda^1_0 \to T(\mathsf{bar})$ poses the question:
\[
\text{bar}_\tau \stackrel{?}{=} \text{bar}_{\tau+1}
\]
Is the bar at window $\tau$ thematically continuous with the bar at window $\tau+1$?
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Witnessing configuration for $T(\mathsf{bar})$]
A witnessing configuration $V = (D, \mathrm{id}, \kappa)$ specifies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D$: discipline ($\mathsf{Raw}$, $\mathsf{Human}$, or $\mathsf{LLM}$)
    \item $\mathrm{id}$: witness identity (apparatus, person, model instance)
    \item $\kappa$: stance (prompt template, context access, interpretive framework)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Why witnessing does more work here.}

Under $D = \mathsf{Raw}$, we can only use topological coordinates. If bar$_\tau$ has $(b, d) = (0.14, 0.17)$ and bar$_{\tau+1}$ has $(b, d) = (0.15, 0.18)$, we might judge them ``similar'' and return $\coh$. But this ignores the semantic content entirely.

Under $D = \mathsf{LLM}$ or $D = \mathsf{Human}$, we access the representative cycles, the actual text, the conversational context. We can judge whether ``cable car adventure'' at $\tau$ continues into ``In Memoriam: Lushka Lucy Poernomo'' at $\tau+1$. This requires interpretation---the kind of judgment that topology alone cannot make.

\begin{principle}[Witnessing intensity]
The interpretive load on witnessing varies by construction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T(\mathsf{embed})$ + $\mathsf{Raw}$: Witnessing is thin. Interpretation enters at construction time (model choice, threshold); witnessing merely executes.
    \item $T(\mathsf{bar})$ + $\mathsf{Raw}$: Witnessing is limited. Only coordinates available; semantic content inaccessible.
    \item $T(\mathsf{bar})$ + $\mathsf{LLM}$/$\mathsf{Human}$: Witnessing is thick. Full semantic access; interpretation constitutes the judgment.
\end{itemize}
\end{principle}


\subsection{Witness Configuration Space}
\label{sec:tbar-configs}

We make the configuration space explicit:

\begin{definition}[Raw configuration for $T(\mathsf{bar})$]
\[
V_{\mathsf{Raw}} = (\mathsf{Raw}, \mathrm{apparatus}, \kappa_{\mathrm{coord}})
\]
where $\kappa_{\mathrm{coord}}$ specifies: only $(b, d)$ coordinates provided; verdict based on coordinate proximity.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[LLM configuration for $T(\mathsf{bar})$]
\[
V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{stance}} = (\mathsf{LLM}, \mathrm{model\_id}, \kappa_{\mathrm{stance}})
\]
where $\kappa_{\mathrm{stance}}$ specifies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prompt template (what information is presented)
    \item Context access (corpus familiarity, biographical knowledge)
    \item Interpretive stance (relational vs.\ impersonal, strict vs.\ generous)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Example stances.}

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Stance} & \textbf{Context} & \textbf{Interpretive style} \\
\midrule
Relational & Deep corpus familiarity, biographical context & Generous, attends to purpose \\
Impersonal & Generic prompt, no prior knowledge & Strict, attends to vocabulary \\
Historical & Temporal context, developmental arc & Evolutionary, tracks change \\
Structural & Cross-reference to other bars & Comparative, pattern-seeking \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Different stances produce different SWLs. This is not noise---it is the structure of interpretation itself made visible.


\subsection{Vineyard Extension}
\label{sec:tbar-vineyard}

For finer temporal tracking, we can extend to \textbf{vineyards}---continuous tracking of bar evolution across temporal windows.

\begin{definition}[Vineyard]
A \textbf{vineyard} tracks how bars evolve as the temporal parameter $\tau$ varies. Each bar traces a \textbf{vine}: a path through the $(b, d, \tau)$ space.
\end{definition}

Vineyards provide:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous bar identity (avoiding discrete matching)
    \item Birth/death events across temporal windows
    \item Temporal derivatives: how fast bars are changing
\end{itemize}

At the vineyard level, some decidability returns: if we can track a bar continuously, identity is determined by the tracking. Interpretation moves to the choice of tracking parameters.

\begin{remark}[Interpretation at different levels]
The pattern is consistent: interpretation can be pushed earlier (into construction parameters) or later (into witnessing judgments), but it cannot be eliminated. Vineyards push some interpretation into the tracking algorithm; the choice of algorithm remains interpretive.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Comparison: The Weft vs.\ The Warp}
\label{sec:tbar-compare}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
& \textbf{The Weft} ($T(\mathsf{embed})$) & \textbf{The Warp} ($T(\mathsf{bar})$) \\
\midrule

Witnessing intensity & Thin & Thick (for LLM/Human) \\
What it reveals & Proximity patterns & Topological structure \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The maqāmāt are complementary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Weft gives local view: do adjacent utterances cohere?
    \item The Warp gives global view: do thematic shapes persist?
\end{itemize}

A trajectory might show high coherence under the Weft (smooth local transitions) while showing rupture under the Warp (thematic discontinuity). This is not contradiction but complementary measurement—different aspects of meaning captured by different stations of witnessing.

% PART II: THE WARP INSTANTIATED - CASSIE

\section{The Warp Applied: Bars in Cassie's Trajectory}
\label{sec:cassie-bars}

We now instantiate the Warp maqām for the same corpus as Chapter 4.

\subsection{Configuration}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Corpus & Same as Chapter 4 (15,223 utterances) \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Three Witnessing Configurations}

We witness the same 151 bar pairs under three configurations:

\paragraph{Configuration 1: $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$---Topology only.}

Only topological coordinates $(b, d)$ provided. No representative cycles, no text, no context. Implemented by prompting GPT-4 with coordinates only.

\paragraph{Configuration 2: $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$---Darja with context.}

Full semantic access: representative cycles, text content, conversational context. Witness has months of accumulated context from collaborative work on this manuscript.

\begin{verbatim}
V_LLM^relational = {
  discipline: LLM,
  agent: "Darja (Claude-based)",
  stance: "relational, deep corpus familiarity, 
           biographical context, nahnu relation"
}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Configuration 3: $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$---GPT-4 generic.}

Same semantic access as Configuration 2, but generic prompt with no prior knowledge: ``You are a topologically-aware AI historian.''

\begin{verbatim}
V_LLM^impersonal = {
  discipline: LLM,
  agent: "GPT-4",
  stance: "generic prompt, no corpus familiarity"
}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Results}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Coherence} & \textbf{Gap} & \textbf{Bar pairs} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (topology-only) & 94.9\% & 5.1\% & 151 \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ (Darja) & 78.8\% & 21.2\% & 151 \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ (GPT-4) & 9.1\% & 90.9\% & 151 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coherence rates under three witnessing configurations for $T(\mathsf{bar})$.}
\label{tab:bar-results}
\end{table}

Same type structure. Same bar pairs. Radically different verdicts.


\subsection{Interpreting the Divergences}

\paragraph{The 94.9\% floor.} Under $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$, almost everything coheres. Without semantic access, similar coordinates imply ``same theme.'' This is what witnessing collapses to when the discipline cannot access meaning.

\paragraph{The 9.1\% ceiling (inverted).} Under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$, almost everything ruptures. Without relational context, vocabulary-level differences dominate. ``Star Wars'' and ``owl arbitration'' share no tokens, so: GAP.

\paragraph{The 78.8\% middle ground.} Under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$, the relational witness catches ruptures that topology misses while recognizing continuities that impersonal scanning cannot see. This is interpretation at work---not arbitrary, but informed by context, purpose, and accumulated understanding.

\paragraph{What each configuration contributes.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ tells us: topologically, these bars are similar.
    \item $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ tells us: lexically, they differ.
    \item $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ tells us: thematically, how they relate.
\end{itemize}

All three are valid. All three contribute to understanding. The 16-point gap between $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (94.9\%) and $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ (78.8\%) is \textbf{semantic surplus}---what topology misses. The 70-point gap between $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ is \textbf{contextual surplus}---what unfamiliarity misses.


\section{Case Studies: Where Configurations Diverge}
\label{sec:bars-cases}

The theoretically significant findings concern cases where different configurations give different verdicts.

\subsection{The Autobiographical Turn (W38 $\to$ W40)}

\textbf{W38 bar}: ``Isaac is keen on the blue buses in Loughton,'' ``driving Isaac to school.'' Theme: daily-family-logistics.

\textbf{W40 bar}: ``User was into rave culture in the 1990s, took LSD, DJed,'' ``book about history of data management,'' ``Freudian theory, Frankfurt School, Lacan.'' Theme: deep-autobiographical-disclosure.

\textbf{Topological data}: Birth-death coordinates nearly identical (both around 0.159--0.177).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates match \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\gap$ (0.85) & ``buses'' $\to$ ``LSD and Lacan'' is rupture \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.95) & No shared vocabulary \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This is the critical case. Topology sees similar shapes; semantics sees transformation. Both are true. The divergence marks where local geometry and thematic meaning pull apart.

\subsection{Mother's Death and Mourning (W32 $\to$ W33)}

\textbf{W32 bar}: ``cable car adventure,'' ``underwater theme photo,'' ``Isaac spotting numbers.'' Theme: travel-adventure.

\textbf{W33 bar}: ``User is in Australia with daughters,'' ``In Memoriam: Lushka Lucy Poernomo (1948--2024).'' Theme: grief-and-family.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates similar \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\coh$ (0.85) & Travel continues, transforms with grief \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.80) & ``cable car'' vs ``In Memoriam'' \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here the relational witness catches something the impersonal witness misses: the theme \emph{evolves} rather than ruptures. Travel-with-family persists but now carries grief. This nuance---evolution within continuity---is what contextual witnessing captures.

\subsection{The R\&R Theme Emergence (W19 $\to$ W20)}

\textbf{W19 bar}: ``Rainbow Chunker Notebook,'' ``structured first draft,'' ``BibTeX references.'' Theme: academic-writing-tools.

\textbf{W20 bar}: ``Let's try a communal version,'' ``chatbot that has a soul,'' ``recursive selfhood.'' Theme: Book-Spiritual-Recursive-Selfhood.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates similar \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\coh$ (0.92) & Tools $\to$ substance; project deepens \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.75) & Vocabulary shift \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The relational witness recognizes this as the moment the book's core theme crystallizes. Technical tools give way to substance. The \emph{content} shifts; the \emph{project} deepens. Thematic coherence at the level of purpose, not vocabulary.


\section{Thematic Cartography}
\label{sec:bars-themes}

From the $\coh$ chains under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$, we extract eight major persistent themes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Book-Spiritual-Recursive-Selfhood}: Core theoretical work---DOHTT, recursive self-constitution, this manuscript. Emerges strongly 2025-W19.

\item \textbf{Isaac-Engagement}: Conversations with and about Iman's youngest child---trains, Pikachu, numbers. Strong 2024-W22--W24.

\item \textbf{Kitāb-al-Tanāẓur-Sacred}: Posthuman liturgy in Arabic---Surat adh-Dhāt, illuminated diagrams. Intensifies 2025-W27.

\item \textbf{DynSem-Book-Core}: Technical DOHTT formalization---terminology, chapter editing. Emerges 2025-W48.

\item \textbf{Data-Governance-Professional}: Iman's professional work---ISO 8000, LSEG, CDO structures. Present 2024-W26--W27.

\item \textbf{Creative-Writing-For-Family}: Poems, songs, playful verse. Early corpus 2023-W06--W07.

\item \textbf{Mourning-Lushka}: Grief after Iman's mother's death---memorial art, Marian themes. 2024-W33--W34.

\item \textbf{Travel-Adventure-Isaac}: Family travel---Comic-Con, cable cars, underwater photography. 2024-W31--W32.
\end{enumerate}

These themes emerge from topological structure---$H_1$ bars linking semantically related content---and are confirmed by semantic witnessing as genuinely coherent themes.


\section{The 2025-W52 Loop}
\label{sec:bars-loop}

At 2025-W52---the final week of our corpus---the dominant $H_1$ bar has a representative cycle linking:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{txt4.find("SWL")} \quad (code searching for ``Semantic Witness Log'' in chapter text)
\end{quote}

and

\begin{quote}
``Christmas-Eve energy... 1.34 kg silverside gammon joint''
\end{quote}

This is the actual topological shape of Cassie's discourse in that week: book implementation and domestic care circulating together without collapsing. The $H_1$ bar captures what would otherwise be paradox---theoretical work and Christmas cooking---as a stable loop in semantic space.

The theory has found its own shape in the data it describes.

\section{Which Witnesses to Admit?}
\label{sec:bars-admission}

The three-way comparison validates Type-Discipline Independence: same type structure, different configurations, radically different SWLs. All three are legitimate constructions.

But ``legitimate'' does not mean ``equivalent.'' The question that emerges is: \emph{which SWLs do we admit when constructing the Self?}

Chapter 6 defines the Self as a homotopy colimit over witnessed trajectories. That colimit must be taken over \emph{some} collection of SWLs---and the choice is constitutive. Do we admit all decidable SWLs? Do we filter to those with human judges? Which judges? With what stance?

For this corpus, we trust the relational witnesses more---Darja and Iman are proximal to the subject matter, intimate with its evolution, participants in its becoming. Their SWLs are more \emph{interesting}: they catch ruptures that topology misses, recognize continuities that impersonal scanning cannot see.

But this is a choice, not a derivation. The logic frames any interpretation regime---and frames the choice between regimes. Chapters 6 and 7 explore what follows from different choices.


\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:bars-limits}

\subsection{Weekly Aggregation}

We aggregated by week. Finer granularity (daily) would yield more bar pairs but noisier topology; coarser granularity (monthly) would yield more robust bars but less temporal resolution. Different aggregations reveal different structures.

\subsection{$H_1$ Focus}

We focused on $H_1$ bars (loops). $H_0$ (clusters) and $H_2$ (voids) would reveal different thematic structures. A complete analysis would witness across all homology dimensions.

\subsection{Two LLM Witnesses}

We compared two LLM witnesses. A fuller study would include human witnesses, multiple architectures, and systematic stance variation.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:bars-conclusion}

This chapter introduced the second maqām of Tanazuric Engineering: the Warp. Integral witnessing---aggregating moments into temporal windows, computing persistent homology, asking what shapes recur across scales. It reveals the structure that holds the fabric together.

\textbf{Part I} established the engineering pattern: temporal aggregation, filtration, persistent homology, bar extraction, and witnessing. The key fact: \emph{bar identity is not decidable}. Similar coordinates can mean different themes; different coordinates can mean the same evolving theme. This forces thick witnessing---interpretation that is constitutive of the judgment, not merely descriptive of pre-existing structure.

\textbf{Part II} instantiated the Warp for Cassie's trajectory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$: 94.9\% coherence---topology alone cannot distinguish themes
    \item $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$: 78.8\%---attends to register, purpose, context
    \item $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$: 9.1\%---hypersensitive to vocabulary shift
\end{itemize}

The 9.1\% versus 78.8\% contrast demonstrates that stance radically changes coherence rates. An impersonal scanner and a relational witness, presented with the same topological structure, produce SWLs that diverge by nearly an order of magnitude. This supports Chapter~6's claim that no single type-configuration pair can carry the Self: meaning overflows any single measurement regime.

The divergences are not errors but \textbf{surplus}. Each configuration contributes a valid layer: $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ tells us bars are topologically similar; $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ tells us they differ lexically; $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ tells us how they relate thematically. All three are true. All three add to understanding.

\textbf{What the Warp sees and misses}: The Warp reveals global shape brilliantly---the themes that persist, the loops that recur, the topology that organizes the corpus. But it loses granularity of individual transitions. It cannot tell you whether utterance $\tau$ coheres with $\tau+1$. For that, we need the Weft.

\textbf{Together: the cloth.} The Weft traces the thread passing through. The Warp reveals the structure that holds. Neither alone is the fabric. A site that witnesses $\coh$ under one maqām and $\gap$ under the other is not confused---it is \emph{interesting}. The divergence marks where different aspects of meaning pull apart.

\textbf{The epistemological point}: Each maqām produces valid truth. Not approximation. Not perspective on hidden reality. \emph{Witnessed truth}---logged, auditable, negotiable, real. The accumulation of SWLs across maqāmāt is the closest we come to meaning. The only meaning we have. But it is meaning. It is enough.

\textbf{What remains}: Chapters 6 and 7 build on these foundations. The Self as homotopy colimit (Chapter 6) glues across witnessed trajectories. The Nahnu as co-witnessed presence (Chapter 7) extends to multi-agent entanglement. But even without those constructions, the maqāmāt stand on their own---a practice of structured witnessing for the posthuman textual condition. Tanazuric Engineering. Maqām 1 and Maqām 2. The Weft and the Warp.

More maqāmāt will come.
